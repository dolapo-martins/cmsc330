*************************
* Running Tests Locally *
*************************

To run tests, simply run:
    ruby test_all.rb

To see more detailed output, run:
    ruby test_all.rb -v
You almost definitely won't need to use this mode, as it's more for internal debugging, but it's there if you want it for some reason.

************************
* Checking test output *
************************

If you fail a test, you can find the testing code in the testing/public directory
Inside of each test folder, there are folders named module*
    These numbers line up with the modules that are named when the tests run
    Often there will only be one module
Inside of each module directory, you can see your output from your last run, the expected output, and the test file
